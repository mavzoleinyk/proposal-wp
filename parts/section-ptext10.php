                    <p>Proposing will be one of the most important moments in your life and so you want it to be perfect: we are here for you! On the day of your proposal, you need everything to go smoothly, and that’s where your personal proposal planner takes the wheel. After your booking you will be assigned a personal manager who will stay in touch with you 24/7, there to make any final amendments and confirm venues, flowers, musicians, photographers, dry cleaners, cars and whatever else is necessary for creating the proposal of your partner’s dreams.
                    We have shot more than 2000 proposals over the last 8 years, and can guarantee beautiful results as well as friendly support. We will provide you with a detailed map including the location of your proposal, the best way to arrive there, and the best setup to make your pictures of the day look amazing. Our proposal planners are professionals who know how important this day is for you, and are ready to work hard for the best results.</p>
