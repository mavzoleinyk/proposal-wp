                    <div class="info">
                        <p>New York is one of the most romantic cities in the world. Sure, it’s hectic, but all those lights and narrow streets make for an impossibly romantic mood. There are so many unique ways you can propose in this city, mostly because there’s something for everyone here.</p>
                        <p>Old Italian districts and modern city skyscrapers come together to attract people from all over the world. As long-time residents of the Big Apple, we can recommend the most attractive and romantic places to pop the question.</p>
                        <p>If this is your first time in the city, then the Brooklyn Bridge might be a good place to have your proposal. Walk hand-in-hand across the bridge to the Brooklyn Bridge Park, and ask her to marry you with the breathtaking views of the city as your backdrop.</p>
                        <p>Want a more modern surrounding? The High Line or the Whitney Museum would work just as well. And don’t forget about historical landmarks such as The Cloisters or The Wave Hill, both of which would work perfectly for a day trip.</p>
