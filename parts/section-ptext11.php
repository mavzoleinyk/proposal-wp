                            We will assign you a personal proposal planner, who will set up a Skype or phone session to make sure you get the best proposal idea most suited to you as a couple.

                            We plan all the logistics, reserving the venue, booking talent, delivering flowers and discussing decorations. We send you maps, schedules and plans for where you and your partner should stand for taking the best pictures and videos of your proposal.

                            We provide full general support for the day of your proposal, making sure that everything goes according to plan. We set up decorations, pick up your flowers and make sure our musicians and photographers are in place and ready.

                            With our star photo/video/drone team we will capture the story of your big day, before, during and after the proposal, and create a proposal film and/or photo album of your special day.
