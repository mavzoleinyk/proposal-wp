                <div class="content">
                    <p>New York has many historical landmarks that make for the perfect surroundings for your proposal. The city is full of views for lovers; The Empire State building, Top of the Rock and the new One World Trade Observatory are all dazzling options from which you can choose. Or reserve a table at a rooftop restaurant where you can enjoy not only great views but also delicious cuisine. If your partner is a Sex in the City or a Friends fan, why not go on a movie tour around the city and propose on set? For sports fans, New York has the in-game big screen proposal option. The Knicks, Giants, Jets, NYC Rangers, Yankees and Mets have games year round, so get on your lucky hat and hit the stadium. If that is not enough, there are also helicopter rides, and private yachts for sailing around Manhattan. </p>
                    <p>For art lovers, the Metropolitan Museum and The Frick Collection might be good options for your proposal. Or you might consider taking a private art class, where you can reveal your “Will you Marry Me?” painting at the end of the class. And let’s not forget Times Square, which with all its neon lights and mascots has made NYC the premiere proposal destination.
                        New York City’s Broadway shows are famous worldwide, so if your partner has been dying to see one, get the best tickets you can buy and propose after the show on-stage. And don’t forget about the people in this city! New Yorkers are very supportive and will cheerfully clap to your proposal if you choose to make it public.</p>
                    <p>You can find all kinds of flash mob dancers, acapella singers, superhero characters, magicians and just all-round nice people who are ready to help you deliver a fantastic marriage proposal.
