                    <p>You’ll be telling this story to your kids and grand kids, so you’d better make sure your proposal story is a good one! There are so many good engagement ideas out there, so you’ll need to be unique and keep it romantic. We’ll assist you throughout your planning; our experience in this field gives us an edge on what you can expect from a proposal. Of course, every person is different; we can’t guarantee that your partner will say yes… but we will certainly create the most beautiful atmosphere for a positive answer! So how does it work? A detailed quiz will be sent to you and, based on your answers, we will create 3 appropriate engagement ideas. We work directly with you, taking every little detail of your relationship into consideration. We will work together to make that day perfect for her ( or for him). Our 3 engagement proposal ideas will all come equipped with a list of suitable venues and a detailed map. That leaves the most important part to you: popping the question! Our team will be there to support you during the entire process, making sure that your table is reserved, your flowers are picked up, and the ring is safe in your pocke</p>
