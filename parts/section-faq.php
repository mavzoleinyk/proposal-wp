                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>A surprise proposal can be a memorable and magical experience for both partners, but it's essential to know your partner's preferences. Make sure you both are looking forward to the new stage of your relationship. Keep your partner's personality in mind when choosing the type of proposal you want to do ( public or private)</p>

                        <button class="accordion">What not to do before a proposal?</button>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Avoid discussing the proposal with too many people, raising suspicion, proposing without a ring, proposing too soon, or proposing in a location or situation that your partner might not appreciate. Dont hint that something big is coming up. Dont offer her to do her nails.</p>

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Yes absolutely. Capturing the proposal moment is a great way to preserve the memory. If you decide to hire a photographer, ensure they can be discreet to maintain the surprise element.</p>
